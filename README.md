- 👋 Hi, I’m @jHopkins42
- 👀 I’m interested in table top role playing games, games, woodworking, blacksmithing, making, reading, movies, gaming, computer games, cars, nature, should I go on?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, how to write, how to run a business, how to pretend to be a human
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding
- 📫 How to reach me - the best way is email.  Please be aware that my time is valuable to you and to me, so I will not respond immediately.  I check email daily unless I'm out of the office, and I will respond typically within 24 hours.  Try email at jeremy.hopkins.547@outlook.com

- If there's a project in the realms of Shadowrun (TTRPG), Battletech (TTRPG, minis) or 3d printing you'd like me to look at, let me know.  I won't promise anything yet, but I'd be willing to listen and possibly make an attempt.  Drop me a line and we'll discuss it.

One thing to note: a major part of my online brand is that I do not post full photos of myself.  I might share a portion of me, or my face, or something I'm wearing, but never the full thing.  This is for two primary reasons.  
* First: I'm an ambassador, not a spokesperson.  It is not my function to be in front of the screens selling your items - it is my function to bring your items to people's attention.  The "man behind the curtian," to use a more common metaphor.  (When asked how he did some major illusion, Harry Houdini was reported as stating "very well."  Knowing how the magic is done is only half of the solution - the other half is doing it well enough to satisfy others.  That is my goal.)
* And secondly: I'm involved in many different organizations and groups.  To that end, I compartmentalize many different things.  And to aid in that compartmentalization I use an avatar photo evocative of the thing that is primarily represented in that function or group.  (My Twitter profile is a plate of macaroni, for example.  You can't - and shouldn't - survive on blanched white-flour starch noodles, but you can it to a daily regimen and make it a part of your whole-self health.)  I will not be the only source of information or process function for you, but I am very willing to be a part of it.
