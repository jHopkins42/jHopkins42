- 👋 Hi, I’m @jHopkins42
- 👀 I’m interested in table top role playing games, games, woodworking, blacksmithing, making, reading, movies, gaming, computer games, cars, nature, should I go on?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code, how to write, how to run a business, how to pretend to be a human
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding
- 📫 How to reach me - smoke signals or screaming into the air doesn't work.  Try email at jeremy.hopkins.547@outlook.com

- If there's a project in the realms of Shadowrun (TTRPG), Battletech (TTRPG, minis) or 3d printing you'd like me to look at, let me know.  I won't promise anything yet, but I'd be willing to listen and possibly make an attempt.  Drop me a line and we'll discuss it.
